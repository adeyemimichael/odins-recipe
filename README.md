## This is my first project in the odin project tutorial on frontend path way 
``` i will be using html and css alone for now ```
### Anything i am doing now is just a relearning ###
 what i have learnt in this course 
  1. how the internet really work - which is that the internet is a collection of networks and the internet is a backbone for www. 
  2. for the html5 boiler plate it is written like this : 
3. ````  < !DOCTYPE html>
  <html?>
  <head>
  <meta charset ="UTF-8"
   <title>  Odin project recipe</title>
  </head>

  <body></body>
  </html>

  ````

  4. i learnt about the void element which is the type element that are self closing  
  5. absolute link and relative link relative link are the one inside an element file while absolute link is the one which is outside but used in the file 
  6. noopener and nonreferrer in html link is meant for security and privacy security in the sense that the new tab will not be able to access the other tab it came from for data. while privacy is to keep the content private
